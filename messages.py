Hello!
This is a tool for quickly jotting down various notes and remarks about the important people in your life. 
For instance, you might have a girlfriend named Alice, a friend named Bob, or a startup called TheRocket.

Write, forward, send a photo, or send a voice message to the bot, and it will add it to the profile of the designated person. 
This way, you can compile a list of wishes, preferences, ideas, or anything else related to a specific individual.

At times, the bot will remind you of these notes so you won't forget =)

For example, for Alice:
- Enjoys black and white movies
- Allergic to nuts
- Wants blackberry wine
- Favorite color is beige
- Learn the track 'Perfect' by Ed Sheeran for her
